# Travel Planner App

The **Travel Planner App** is a project developed as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. This application allows users to add, store, and manage their trips, providing features to view weather forecasts for specific departure dates and display images of destinations.

## **Introduction**

The Travel Planner App helps users organize and plan their trips with ease. It allows users to manage their trips, whether they are scheduled for today, upcoming, or in the past. Users can also view the weather forecast for their travel dates using the Weatherbit API and fetch images of their destinations using the Pixabay API. The app stores trip data in the browser's local storage, providing data persistence across sessions.
